#  Comments in Python are identified with a hash symbol (#), and extend to the end of the line.
#  Python does not have a specific syntax for multiline comments as some other programming languages do. 
# Instead, multiline comments are created by enclosing the text within triple quotes (either single quotes ''' or double quotes ").
